Notes based on the review of:
http://www.shopbottools.com/ShopBotDocs/files/SBG%2000142%20User%20Guide%2020150317.pdf

1.  Spacebar should stop any motion.
    The "Start" buttton on the position window becomes a "Stop" button while the tool
    is in motion.  It should respond to the spacebar as if it was clicked on.
   
2.  Software settings should be stored in opensbp.ini - it's the equivalent to the
    shopbot.ini file.  See how [UR] works in order to cause the .ini file to be 
    created.
   
3.  Check position window on sb3 for an absolute/relative position flag as well as absolute/relativ
    control for it.
   
4.  The Preview window is normally only visible when the software is in Preview mode.
    This should be user-controllable as to whether or not they want to see the Preview
    window while the tool is running.
   
5.  ESC should close any Fill-In dialogs.  If ESC is hit while there's no Fil-In window
    open, it should prompt to close the application.

6.  Parameter Line Calculator - see PDF page #12 in the SB user guide...  This feature
    is going to be a fun one...
   
7.  The [UU] Calculator can be triggered by F10.  See "Drop-Down Calculator" in the linked
    doc for more context/info.

8.  Most commands will trigger a Fill-In sheet that's relevant to the command being entered.
    See "Fill-In Sheets".
   
9.  Keyboard Recording: See PDF page 26, "Automatic Recording of Things You Do at the Keyboard"

10. [FP] command should probably be pre-processd in order to load the .sbp file into the same 
    text stream we're feeding the interpreter.
	
11. Input Switches.. #s 2, 3, and 4 are reserved.  2 & 3 are for limit switches, #4 is 
    a soft "stop" input - it reacts the same as hitting the spacebar or the STop button 
	in the software.  I think this is also the "Reset" button on the side of the control
	box.  See "Input Switches, Limit Switches and STOP Inputs" on PDF page 46.
	Which input is the "Start" button wired to?  Note that the M-Code reference starting
	at PDF page 55 has some clues as to what the outputs are hard-wired as.
